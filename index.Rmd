    * Theory assignment: ISL 2.4.2, 2.4.7.
* Programming activities: [One (Jan 24)](ProgrammingActivities/Day-01-Programming-Task.html), [Two (Jan 29)](ProgrammingActivities/Day-02-Programming-Task.html), [Three (Jan 31)](ProgrammingActivities/Day-03-Programming-Task.html)

## Topic 2 --- Linear regression

* Readings.
    - In Chapter 3 of ISL read §3.1 & §3.2
    - Read §3.6 as you work through the commands (see computing assignment)
* Programming basics 2: 
    - Writing functions
    - Visualization: Base graphics, statistical plots
* Assignment 2 --- file `Topic-2.Rmd`
    - Computing
        - work through §3.6. (Style catastrophe: Although the book uses attach(), it is bad practice to do so. Ask about alternatives!)
        - Problem 13 in ISL 3.7.13.
    - Theory 
        - Reading questions.
            1. On p. 66 the authors state, "This is clearly not true in Fig. 3.1" Explain why.
            2. On p. 77 the authors state, "In this case we cannot even fit the multiple regression models using least squares ...." Explain why.
        - ISL 3.7.3 and 3.7.4.
* Programming activities: [Four (Feb 2)](ProgrammingActivities/Day-04-Programming-Task.html), [Five (Feb 7)](ProgrammingActivities/Day-05-Programming-Task.html), [Six (Feb 14)](ProgrammingActivities/Day-06-Programming-Task.html)


## Topic 3 --- Foundations: Linear Algebra, Bayes' Rule, and Likelihood

* Readings
    - These topics are not covered in ISLR, so no readings from the textbook.

## End-of-term Project

In the few weeks of the course, the class will be working on end-of-term projects. You do not need to do anything before that time arrives.

* You'll form groups of two to three students and choose a problem from the Kaggle machine-learning competition site. You don't need to think about this until we get toward the end of the semester. At that point, the in-class programming activities will be given over to the project.
* If you have your own idea for a project, please get my approval before embarking on it.
