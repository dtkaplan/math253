* [Installing and using GitHub from RStudio](github.html)
* [Why I don't use Moodle](why-not-moodle.html)
* Make an account on <GitHub.com> and enter your account ID and the corresponding email address on [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemXlrenuLKVY0GNf-gBGDh6QTkaw3hS7fEZojBxBY3K_e2uA/viewform#responses).

### Due dates

You should "push" your daily programming activity to your repository *before* leaving class. But feel free to revise your work and push again at any time.

Each topic assignment is due one week *after* we finish covering that topic in class.

- Topic I: Sept 20. Note: Ignore the comment in `Topic-1.Rmd` about there not being any exercises. There are exercises, as you can see below.
- Topic II: Oct 6, 2016
- Topic III: Oct 25, 2016
- Topic IV: Nov 3, 2016


## Topic I --- Introduction

* Topics
    - Overview of statistical learning.
    - Getting started with R, RStudio, and RMarkdown
* Reading: Chapter 2 of ISL
* Programming basics 1: Names, classes, and objects
* Assignment 1 --- file `Topic-1.Rmd`
    * Discussion questions: ISL 2.4.1, 2.4.3, 2.4.6
    * Computing assignment: ISL 2.4.8, 2.4.9
        - As an example: [a solution to 2.4.10](Assignments/ISL-2/example-week-2-programming.html).
    * Theory assignment: ISL 2.4.2, 2.4.7.
* Programming activities: [Sept 1](ProgrammingActivities/Day-01-Programming-Task.html), [Sept 6](ProgrammingActivities/Day-02-Programming-Task.html), [Sept 8](ProgrammingActivities/Day-03-Programming-Task.html)

## Topic 2 --- Linear regression

* Readings.
    - In Chapter 3 of ISL read §3.1 & §3.2
    - Read §3.6 as you work through the commands (see computing assignment)
* Programming basics 2: 
    - Writing functions
    - Visualization: Base graphics, statistical plots
* Assignment 2 --- file `Topic-2.Rmd`
    - Computing
        - work through §3.6. (Style catastrophe: Although the book uses attach(), it is bad practice to do so. Ask about alternatives!)
        - Problem 13 in ISL 3.7.13.
    - Theory 
        - Reading questions.
            1. On p. 66 the authors state, "This is clearly not true in Fig. 3.1" Explain why.
            2. On p. 77 the authors state, "In this case we cannot even fit the multiple regression models using least squares ...." Explain why.
        - ISL 3.7.3 and 3.7.4.
* Programming activities: [Sept 20](ProgrammingActivities/Day-04-Programming-Task.html), [Sept 22](ProgrammingActivities/Day-05-Programming-Task.html), [Sept 27](ProgrammingActivities/Day-06-Programming-Task.html)


## Topic 3 --- Foundations: Linear Algebra, Bayes' Rule, and Likelihood

* Readings
    - These topics are not covered in ISLR, so no readings from the textbook.
    - Michael Lavine: "What is Bayesian statistics and why everything else is wrong" [PDF](Resources/Likelihood-Lavine.pdf)
* Programming basics 3: Conditionals
* Visualization: Base graphics: lines, polygons, ...
* Programming Activities: [Oct 4](ProgrammingActivities/Day-07-Programming-Task.html), [Oct 6](ProgrammingActivities/Day-08-Programming-Task.html), [Oct 11](ProgrammingActivities/Day-09-Programming-Task.html)
* Topic assignment: there are no exercises from the textbook, so ... finish the exponential likelihood and taxicab in-class activities. 

## Topic 4 --- Classification

* Readings: In Chapter 4 of ISL §4.1, §4.2, §4.3.1-3, §4.4.1-2, §4.5
* Visualization: Grammar of graphics: glyphs and aesthetics
* Topic 4 Assignment:
    - Programming Assignment: 4.7.11, 4.7.13
    - Theory assignment: 4.7.1, 4.7.8, 4.7.9
* Programming Activities: [Oct 18](ProgrammingActivities/Day-10-Programming-Task.html), [Oct 25](ProgrammingActivities/Day-11-Programming-Task.html), [Oct 27](ProgrammingActivities/Day-12-Programming-Task.pdf)

## Topic 8 --- Tree-based methods

* Readings: Chapter 8 of ISL
* Assignment:
    - programming: 8.4.12
    - theory: In §8.4 problems 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

## Topic 9 --- Support vector machines

* Readings: Chapter 9 of ISL

## Topic 10 --- Unsupervised learning

* Readings: Chapter 10 of ISL



## End-of-term Project

* You'll form groups of two to three students and choose a problem from the Kaggle machine-learning competition site. You don't need to think about this until we get toward the end of the semester. At that point, the in-class programming activities will be given over to the project.
* If you have your own idea for a project, please get my approval before embarking on it.
