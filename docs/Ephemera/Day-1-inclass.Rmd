# Sept 6 In-Class

## Task 5 from Day 1 Programming

```{r}
x <- runif(1000000, min = 0, max = 1)
y <- runif(1000000, min = 0, max = 1)
plot(y ~ x)
dist_to_origin <- sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
```

Proportion less than or equal to 1.
```{r}
result <- ifthen(dist_to_origin < 1, TRUE, FALSE) 
4 * table(dist_to_origin < 1)
```


I'm done now.  Push it. Please.
